# next-themes

Changing the background or overall theme/color of web applications has become a trendy way of improving the UX/UI.
But better, the so many open-source devtools or libraries that enbale this practise to be a common trend are the ones that need more reconing.

Here we are going to take a particular look at how we can take advantage of the [**next-themes**]() package to change the theme color of an app coated with [Tailwind CSS]().

_Assuming you already have a next-app installed & setup, we are going straight to the point._

- Start by getting **next-themes** installed in your project directory:

```bash
$ yarn add next-themes

#or

$ npm install next-themes
```

- Next, add the `ThemeProvider` context provider imported from next-themes in your next-app's `_app.tsx` file and wrap your app's root component inside the provider.

```js
import "../styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider enableSystem={true} attribute="class">
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

Note that we have included two particular configuration props where the first `enableSystem` is optional,
but `attribute` is necessary in this particular case as we are using the class attribute to set the theme color in Tailwind CSS.
We will equally need to set the value to `class` for the `darkMode` option in the `tailwind.config.js` file
_(assuming you've already setup Tailwind CSS in your next-app)_

```js
module.exports = {
  mode: "jit",
  purge: ["./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  darkMode: "class", // here we set it to 'class'
  theme: {},
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

- Finally, implement & use the `useTheme` hook in your app to know the current theme, & eventually change it accordingly.
  We are going to implement it on a `button` element since we want to achieve a toggle effect to change between `light` & `dark` themes.
  Check out the code below to see how it goes:

```js
// pages/index.tsx

import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const { systemTheme, theme, setTheme } = useTheme();

  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

  // to ensure the component is mounted

  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);

  // Render theme button depending on current theme

  const renderThemeButton = () => {
    if (!mounted) return null;
    const currentTheme = theme === "system" ? systemTheme : theme;
    if (currentTheme === "dark") {
      return (
        <>
          <button className="px-2 py-1.5" onClick={() => setTheme("light")}>
            Light
          </button>
        </>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <>
          <button className="px-2 py-1.5" onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}>
            Dark
          </button>
        </>
      );
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div className="container p-4 mx-auto bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800">
        <div className="flex w-full justify-center">{renderThemeButton()}</div>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

Now there you ! Your website becomes more user friendly & attractive with this little trick.
